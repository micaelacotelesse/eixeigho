For me, it's Greedo's death. After he was killed, his head was put on a steak and his body was grounded up into a liqueur. Then his head was retrieved by his clan and given a proper burial. My favorites include Gory Delivery, Gorgasm, Inherit Disease, Brodequin, Cerebral Effusion, Disgorge (USA), Enthrallment, Mindly Rotten, etc.Always looking for new recommendations. What are you guys into? And some sweet vids for the fuck of it: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qj. So just to preface, I’ll fill you in on a little bit of background information: this happened to me the summer after I graduated from high school. I was seventeen at the time (I’m one of those people born in late July who graduated before turning eighteen). And I’d been spending a lot of time at a local karaoke cafe. You know, one of those places where people get drunk before going up on stage with a group of friends and belting “Take on Me” or some shit at the top of their lungs. Because i posted the Fleets in before the 'no screenshot'-thingie was in effect, i have to repost this one so it can be linked non-stop again. It's also a glorious treat to read too! As this is a repost, i can add stuff in so Behemoth, Kraken amp Leviathan have something cool for them too and not just their descriptions.^^^Rumors-abound-that-Leviathan-has-more-battle-excerpts-compared-to-the-others-may-or-may-not-be-true.Please-consult-the-closest-priest-of-the-Four-Armed-Emperor-for-any-que. She's been dead three hours now. Sitting with my laptop, huddled in the corner of my flat, I still can't believe I'm writing this. It doesn't seem real. None of it seems real. A week ago we were on holiday together, and now. now I have to get this down. That's the main thing. I need to get it down, or no one will believe me. Shit, I'm not sure even I believe me. Although I can still see. it when I shut my eyes, a part of my brain is already working to convince Jack Snowling was an alright bloke. He had a decent job managing a sporting goods store a couple minutes bicycle ride from his flat. He got along alright with his roommates, played Starcraft 2, ate pizza with his mates on the weekends, and was an attentive lover to his girlfriend Hannah. He had a dog named Amy, a border collie he had paid to get trained professionally who was, as he often bragged, scary smart. He went to the gym three times a week, fantasised about being a football 
“I didn't know what to get you for your birthday until I read about this and thought it was perfect,” I stared down at the single admission ticket in my hand as I stood on the steps of what looked like an gigantic old grindhouse that still undoubtedly had actual films in the projector booth. Lisa had left me there on the sidewalk, beeping her horn as she ran a stop sign and disappeared into the quiet night. She knew I enjoyed being scared, she knew I enjoyed grindhouse flicks Elissa humans and other close relatives within the family Hominidae are not Herbivores, none of them are and neither are other primates. In fact essentially all primates are omnivores or “generalists” , many simply have a heavily plant based diet. Orangutans for example have a diet of about 60% fruit augmented by large quantities of leaves and shoots, they’re also known to consume bark , bird eggs , insects and small mammals. Gorillas too are primarily plant eaters and almost entirely “folivorou. People thought I was soulless because of my job, even before the events that I'm here to talk about. They think capitalizing on human emotions is cruel. Marketing firms like mine are constantly looking for a way to ingratiate their product in social consciousness. In layman's terms, we want people to notice our work without realizing it. We want them talking. What you're probably most aware of is companies on social media trying to sound cool. Target making snappy comebacks to facebook. Emma yawned and looked over at jade as she woke up from their long night of partying. Jade was beautiful, standing at 5,12 Jade had always been an object of Emma’s affection, she had tried subtlety for years to get Jade to notice her, but so far nothing had worked. Jade woke up and gave a morning stretch, exposing her barley clothed body to the morning sunlight, her flawless skin almost glowing in front of the open window. Emma took it all in, her stare flowed from her lush blond --- I'm Myra Kindle and this is a special series about an unusual dream I've been having. I believe it might be connected to my reporting. ampnbsp; This is Part 3 Part 1 (https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/bifxm6/im_reporter_myra_kindle_but_this_is_not_a_report/) - Part 2 (https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/biusl5/im_myra_kindle_but_this_is_not_a_report_this_is/) - Part 3 --- #Myra Kindle After yesterday's post, I got some suggestions to look into earlier repor.

This report is a few years old. It took place in 2015/16, and I've posted it on Bluelight in 2017. Doses/substances consumed: Datura: somwhere between 30 and 40, 45 seeds.

Well I’m certainly jealous of you, because even though I would say I have outstanding literary and abstract thinking abilities, there is not much else about me that can be considered particularly noteworthy. Perhaps I would’ve discovered different talents that I didn’t have if I didn’t have neglectful parents, or I found a strong source of motivation that pushed me to excel. But all that doesn’t matter, the milk is spilled. Anyway, without having all that exceptional talent, I can understand. 
The Tyranids, besides being a numerically gigantic threat with multiple galaxies worth of biomass, have a basic win condition of destroying everything any other faction in the Milky Way needs to survive. If they strip the galaxy even the Dark Eldar and Chaos are screwed because those need prey from the material realm. No more emotions, no more worship, no more souls, no more anything. Ever. The Necrons would be forever damned to not get flesh bodies back because all that could become flesh. There’s a reason you don’t find much life underground. Sure, a wolf pack might take shelter in a cave during a nasty storm. The occasional moth might venture into unknown caverns. But wolves and moths are not true cave dwellers. True cave dwellers are what the Greeks called troglobites, meaning any animal living entirely underground, never leaving. So seldom do these creatures see light that most troglobites are born completely blind. Take for instance the cave fish or the cave wolf spider. (2018) The House That Jack Built In my mind, this is Lars Von Trier's masterpiece and Matt Dillon's best performance to date. It's hands down the most fun, engaging, darkly humorous, disturbing, bleak and creative film I've seen this year. Runners-up: Annihilation , Apostle , The Bad Seed , Summer of 84 , Mandy , Upgrade , Calibre , Hereditary , A Quiet Place , Bird Box (2017) Mother! Mother! is an incredibly conscientious statement on the nature of humanity, steeped. Air was traveling all around me, moving in circles like an invisible hurricane. Slight waves were hitting the mossy rocks, or more like caressing them ever so slightly. I looked at the small lake, maybe ten meters wide, maybe a bit more. My small flashlight was barely illuminating all of it, water shaking from the draft reflecting it, a white orb sourced from a natural stone balcony. It gave off a different feeling, one that is hard to really pinpoint. Walls going up to the circular </p>

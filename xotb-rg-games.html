RavenGuard Games LLC is looking for developers to help us get our company off the ground. We want to publish your title and split the profits 60/40. 60% going to you (The developer) and 40% going to our company and market fees. We are currently a small company with only 4 members looking to potentially grow, (And ultimately quit our day jobs lol). This is where we need you! We currently have 1 development team under us and we are looking for more teams to help out. If you have any questions. If you're an indie game developer, or make flash-based games on the side. we are looking for you! We are a small company looking for individuals such as yourself to develop games for the Android Market and Steam! Help us grow as we help you get your name out there in the gaming community. I hope to hear from a lot of you :D:D If you have questions and want a detailed description of what we want to do, please contact us at ravenguardgames@gmail.com. I really do not want to use the Epic storefront. It's crap, it's separated from my main games library on steam, and it's inconvient. On top of that, until very recently I was salty that RG:O focused on smaller ships instead of larger (capital) ships, so I thought, "oh, I can wait a year for the noncompete to go out of effect and buy it on Steam." But. I had a really positive interaction (as a customer and a fan) with Travis Baldree, one of the founders of Double Damage recently--he. The rg in qc has to be the most incosistent weapom ever. Even if i have 30 ping i miss some super clean shots which should've hit if this was quake live. Fix this please. Armchair analysis. What should he change in his game to have a winning chance against these easy favourites. I hate Royal Giant and I think I'm not the only one. It's a no skilled card braindead super strong card at the moment that's toxic for the game with it's existance. Man I mean, I really hate it. Went into every RG game in Clash TV for the past weeks just to see it lose on a higher ladder. And it's not only that I'm a salty rager (which I definetly am): Buffing it makes it overpowered, nerfing kills it. There is no mid-term balance that I can see on how the card works. IMO there are situatio. With all the recent changes to our o-line I’ve been thinking about our past lines. If you had to make a starting lineup of current and former Panthers, what would it look like? LT: Jordan Gross LG: Andrew Nowell C: Ryan Kalil RG: Trai Turner RT: Daryl Williams Alternate: Travelle Wharton - he played a solid LT and a great guard. We haven’t had any stud RTs (unless I’m forgetting someone) so I’m basing this off the second team all-pro recognition and his potential. Sorry for the noob question but I am confused about this and find it hard to get info online. I've been trying to get the recommended gear for my templar follower and it took AGES to get the relic so he won't die but everything else I am getting DEX as the main stat and apparently I can't enchant the dex into str? or am I missing something? But I am up to killing GR 70 stuff so I am getting a fair number of legendaries but very very few things I can use for my templar. Thanks I, as an new Tachikaze player, know that Accel really needs the front trigger mechanic to be good, mainly because of the hit or miss and sometimes very combo heavy playstyle with accel, but I feel like every gift should have a specific trigger that gives them a little boost in interesting gameplay. I made a post very similar to this with very varying feedback, and I personally have grown as a player since that post, so I’ll try to do my best to balance things out. Force - Stand Trigger - Stand.

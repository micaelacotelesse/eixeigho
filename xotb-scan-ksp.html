For a full description of both stack and SCANsat resource scanning methods check out the SCANsat. I know they're in like a beta mode, but I see all of these awesome robot arms and craft that unfold like origami and can't get that to work myself. It'll all work perfectly in the VAB and then as soon as the craft launches it'll all get gobbled up by the kraken. Everything either immediately starts shaking like a dog on the 4th of july (my poor puppy :( ) or waits until I try to use the hinges and then blows up. I've tried to do things where nothing is part clipped just to test things 
The M700 Survey Scanner is an orbital low resolution resource scanner is used to map broad areas of resource concentration on a celestial body. It provides a low detail overview of the entire celestial Ok so i got the game and now i managed to get to minmus on career mode. Im having a really hard time knowing where all time biomes are though. Is there a mod or anything similar that shows where all the biomes are. Biome maps seem just as confusing. SCANsat: Real Scanning, Real Science, Warp Speed!  Manage, install and update your addons/mods free with the Twitch Desktop App for Windows & macOS. I'd very much like to install the Kethane mod, but the only location it seems to reside is on the forums, and the forums are migrating right now :( Am I being dense? Does anyone know where I could find this mod? Thanks. Kentucky State Police responding to an off-duty Hopkinsville police officer shot and killed.  For example, I took up 1 goo canister and after that I had no idea what to do next. Eventually I took up another canister and realised it can be observed in space as well as in the atmosphere. So where are the "mission objectives" in this game? How do I find out all the types of research I can do, and how to achieve it? Most other games have some kind of narrative like that, but it seems to be missing in Kerbal.

Hi and thanks in advance, today I downloaded the latest version of kathane and all parts are in the game and the main menu even has the kathane map on it, but when I attempt to scan nothing happens, no sound nothing! The map won't reveal anything (the map doesn't even appear) and I don't know what to do! -thanks SCANsat will scan celestial bodies for resources using the new stock resource system.  Unlike some other KSP scanning systems, SCANsat allows scanning with multiple vessels. All online scanners scan at the same time during any scene where time progresses;. I am figuring out how to run Krag's amazing mod with various mods and so far I am liking what I am seeing. The only issue I am having right now is I can't figure out how to get ISA MapSat to scan his planets. Granted, I haven't actually flown out to one of them yet, but they don't show up when I click through the planet list on the MapSat GUI in-game. Any ideas? There is a file in the mod called hilo.dat that contains the lower and upper bounds of collection data for each planetary body, could. The Slope map is generated from either HI or LO data. The Biome scan only works for bodies that have biomes. For vanilla KSP, this means all planets except Hello, I am starting to get random extremely bad fps drops. For example, right now I am trying to propel my mun base into its orbit, however whenever I begin my burn from the Kerbal orbit, the FPS drops to 5fps. I am on shit settings with a reasonably strong computer.

I am Cija, Manage of EU Contenders team Young and Beautiful (YaB). 2019 opens a new chapter in our team’s story with a fresh roster mix of highly experienced veterans matched with rising young talent. I’d like to introduce you to the players/staff and give you an idea of what to expect from us this Contenders season. Our first game is this Friday where we go up against powerhouse Angry Titans. amp#x200B; The Team's Background Young and Beautiful has developed a great legacy. Versions of KSP prior to 1.0.5 are not supported and will break; I'm not seeing any Universal Storage parts.  Conducts a simple anomaly scan on a planet whenever science is collected; this is used by the anomaly scanner instrument and for anomaly contracts. Yeah I get it, its not a big deal and I'm sure these posts are everywhere, but I just felt like sharing this anyway. A friend of mine knew I was really in to space stuff. I love watching launches, I watch documentaries all the time, and I just generally wont shut up about new space exploration stuff. So he decided to introduce me to KSP. I can safely say it has effectively destroyed my productivity lately. After tinkering around in sandbox mode, and a normal career mode for maybe 10 hours. One of the best mods for Kerbal Space Program, SCANsat adds mapping functionality to KSP, it also integrates beautifully with other mods such as Kethane. TL:DR: the title. So I’ve got this doubt in my head. I’m playing my career from fist time I started ksp some months ago and I’m now on route for my first fly-by to Duna (ETA one year). The “rocket” (https://imgur.com/gallery/WK01M59) has some crew to gain experience, will perform gravity and aerobrake, and release a little but complete scanner probe which I’ll set in polar orbit to prepare the future landing missions. It then will get back to kerbin and land at ksc entirely. I haven’t unlocked. 
As far as I know nothing in vanilla KSP detects anomalies. They were sort of abandoned long ago and with map updates many of the anomalies are now underground or floating Red shell is a Spyware that tracks data of your PC and shares it with 3rd parties. On their website they formulate it all in very harmless language, but the fact is that this is software from someone i don't trust and whom i never invited, which is looking at my data and running on my pc against my will. This should have no place in a full price PC game, and in no games if it were up to me. I make this thread to raise awareness of these user unfriendly marketing practices and data mining softwa. ksp хочет, чтобы вы одновременно были администратором, инженером, пилотом, учёным и менеджером.

I'm trying to perform the FFT of a 100Khz signal using the STM32 Discovery board but I'm relatively new to the STM32 DSP in general. I've read up on a few things over the past few weeks and I've been trying to get a basic implementation working. Additionally, I've been following the basic working example here (https://stm32f4-discovery.net/2014/10/stm32f4-fft-example/)as well and adapted it to the F7 board. Haven't played since 0.24, just wondering if there has been added a stock part that can scan a body for biomes. With the recently announced Moa companions and with DE's recent "we're listening" phase, I think now is the proper time for DE to finally take steps to improve all companions in Warframe. gtTL;DR: gt gt1. Remove Precept mods and bake in Companion abilities, while adding a clear method of setting ability priorities. gt2. Improve companion targeting using context-sensitive waypoints and commands, while also improving waypoints in general. gt3. Give Sentinels some personality, improve. Would you like to help improve its quality by submitting build and fixing defects? Add me to project. Evening All, amp#x200B; First of all i live in the U.K and timing may be important here. So on the 09/11/18 i fired up my computer (intel i7, gtx 970, asus hero VII motherboard) for some gaming on shadow of war and my usually solid 60fps is now down to 20. I tested this on all other games i had installed of varying beefiness (GTA 5, Rimworld, KSP) and they all showed about a third drop in FPS. A week later and i've tried the following: Full antivirus scan with multiple anti virus's.

Scanner Frequencies and Radio Frequency Reference for KY State Police. So I recently got back into KSP and I while I have played since CommNet was introduced, I really never paid attention to it. That is until I put a few satellites into Kerbin Orbit (one polar and one KEO) and saw a satellite I have orbiting minmus was still just trying to connect directly to KSC. So I started reading about CommNet and I have some questions. 1. Communotron vs Antenna. In plain english what is the difference? Right now I am assuming Communotrons send signals out but canno.

I started a fresh career and have three ScanSats in orbit of Kerbin and it's moons, two scientists on month long orbit contracts and over 1m in the bank. I have learnt today about ScanSat, orbit inclination, orbit eccentricity, acending nodes and unmanned rockets. Lots of pausing and googling but thanks to fantastic community out there the answers where all out there. Note that you only need one radial scanner active, but I have installed two in order to keep the satellite balanced along the axis. Payload cost is only 6850 with a mass of 922kg.

Once they stop talking it takes 14-18 seconds be for it starts to scan again. So I have this probe I've painstakenly got into a perfect circular polar low Venus orbit (220k on the dot), and have been running low-rez scan before bumping up to 5k to do the hi-rez. Get to 100% on the scan after about 6 months in orbit, go to check on spacecraft, and antenna is showing thermal overload, craft has no connection even though Earth has LOS (yes power was full and everything else was fine). What gives? So I warp a couple of days forward, and when I do, the antenna is just missing.
